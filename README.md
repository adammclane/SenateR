# SenateR

Ever wanted to know the current age of pollitical representitives by party? By using Govtrack.us, this code does just that. 

It leverages the following packages in R:

jsonlite
Rcurl
doBy
lubridate
dplyr
ggplot2

There are a number of applications with this dataset, but I started with something simple: use the "birthdate" field in the data to create a ggplot2 density plot of age!
